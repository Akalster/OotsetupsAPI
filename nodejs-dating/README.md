# Dating App API

This is an API for the database of a dating app. Users can like each other and find their matches. It also gives suggestions based on the hobbies of users.

## Running

Start index.js in Nodejs or host the app on for example heroku. It uses a Neo4j database hosted by graphene and a MongoDB database hosted by mLab. 

Take a look in the routes.js file to see what routes can be addressed.
